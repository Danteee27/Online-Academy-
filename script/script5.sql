I would recommend this course and any others that he offers. Thanks, Max!</em></p>\r\n<p><em>As a person new to both JavaScript and Angular 2 I found this course extremely helpful because Max does a great job of explaining all the important concepts behind the code. Max has a great teaching ability to focus on what his audience needs to understand.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>This Course uses TypeScript</strong></p>\r\n<p>TypeScript is the main language used by the official Angular&nbsp;team and the language you\'ll mostly see in Angular tutorials. It\'s a superset to JavaScript and makes writing Angular&nbsp;apps really easy. Using it ensures, that you will have the best possible preparation for creating Angular&nbsp;apps. Check out the free videos for more information.</p>\r\n<p>TypeScript knowledge is, however, not required - basic JavaScript knowledge is enough.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why Angular?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Angular&nbsp;is the next big deal. Being the successor of the overwhelmingly successful Angular.js framework it&rsquo;s bound to shape the future of frontend development in a similar way. The powerful features and capabilities of Angular&nbsp;allow you to create complex, customizable, modern, responsive and user friendly web applications.</p>\r\n<p>Angular 13&nbsp;simply is the latest version of the Angular framework and simply an update to Angular 2.</p>\r\n<p>Angular is faster than Angular 1 and offers a much more flexible and modular development approach. After taking this course you&rsquo;ll be able to fully take advantage of all those features and start developing awesome applications immediately.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the drastic differences between Angular 1 and Angular&nbsp;(=Angular 13)&nbsp;you don&rsquo;t need to know anything about Angular.js to be able to benefit from this course and build your futures projects with Angular.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Get a very deep understanding of how to create Angular&nbsp;applications</strong></p>\r\n<p>This course will teach you all the fundamentals about modules, directives, components, databinding, routing, HTTP access and much more! We will take a lot of deep dives and each section is backed up with a real project. All examples showcase the features Angular&nbsp;offers and how to apply them correctly.</p>',4,NULL,4,32,'2023-01-07',1,0),(44,'Modern React with Redux [2023 Update]',1,4,5.0,1,'1OaJWquNGu-FgeQ8ufC0zjeX6DsLZm7yc',2199000,0,5,'Master React and Redux Toolkit.
